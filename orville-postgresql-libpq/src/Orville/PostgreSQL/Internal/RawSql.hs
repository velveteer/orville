  'RawSql' provides a type for efficiently constructing raw sql statements
  from smaller parts and then executing them. It also supports using placeholder
  values to pass parameters with a query without having to interpolate them
  as part of the actual sql state and being exposed to sql injection.

{- |
  Provides procedures for escaping parts of a raw SQL query so that they
  can be safely executed. Escaping may be done in some 'Monad' m, allowing
  for the use of escaping operations provided by 'Connection', which operate
  in the 'IO' monad.

  See 'connectionEscaping' and 'exampleEscaping'.
-}
data Escaping m = Escaping
  { escapeStringLiteral :: BS.ByteString -> m BS.ByteString

{- |
  Escaping done in pure Haskell that is suitable for showing SQL examples,
  but is not guaranteed to be sufficient for all database connections. For
  escaping that is based on the actual connection to the database, see
  'connectionEscaping'.

{- |
  Escaping done in IO based using the escaping functions provided by the
  connection, which can apply escaping based on the specific connection
  properties.

  If you don't have a connection available and are only planning on using
  the SQL for explanatory or example purposes, see 'exampleEscaping'.

  Escaping

{- |
  Constructs the actual SQL bytestring and parameter values that will be
  passed to the database to execute a 'RawSql' query. Any string
  literals thar are included in the SQL expression will be escaping
  using the given escaping directive.

  pure
    ( LBS.toStrict (BSB.toLazyByteString byteBuilder)

    )

{- |
  Builds the bytes that represent the raw sql. These bytes may not be executable
  on their own, because they may contain placeholders that must be filled in,
  but can be useful for inspecting sql queries.
-}
toExampleBytes :: SqlExpression sql => sql -> BS.ByteString
toExampleBytes =
  fst . runIdentity . toBytesAndParams exampleEscaping

{- |
  This is an internal datatype used during the sql building process to track
  how many params have been seen so that placeholder indices (e.g. '$1', etc)
  can be generated to include in the sql.
-}
data ParamsProgress = ParamsProgress
  { paramCount :: Int
  , paramValues :: DList (Maybe PgTextFormatValue)
  }

{- |
  An initial value for 'ParamsProgress' that indicates no params have been been
  encountered yet.
-}
startingProgress :: ParamsProgress
startingProgress =
  ParamsProgress
    { paramCount = 0
    , paramValues = DList.empty
    }

{- |
  Adds a parameter value to the end of the params list, tracking the count
  of parameters as it does so.
-}

snocParam (ParamsProgress count values) newValue =
  ParamsProgress
    { paramCount = count + 1

    }

{- |
  Constructs a bytestring builder that can be executed to get the bytes for a
  section of 'RawSql'. This function takes and returns a 'ParamsProgress' so
  that placeholder indices (e.g. '$1') and their corresponding parameter values
  can be tracked across multiple sections of raw sql.

{- |
  Constructs a 'RawSql' from a 'String' value using utf8 encoding.

  Note that because the string is treated as raw sql it completely up to the
  caller to protected againt sql-injections attacks when using this function.
  Never use this function with input read from an untrusted source.
-}
fromString :: String -> RawSql
fromString =
  SqlSection . BSB.stringUtf8

{- |
  Constructs a 'RawSql' from a 'Text' value using utf8 encoding.

  Note that because the text is treated as raw sql it completely up to the
  caller to protected againt sql-injections attacks when using this function.
  Never use this function with input read from an untrusted source.
-}
fromText :: T.Text -> RawSql
fromText =
  SqlSection . TextEnc.encodeUtf8Builder

{- |
  Constructs a 'RawSql' from a 'ByteString' value, which is assumed to be
  encoded sensibly for the database to handle.

  Note that because the string is treated as raw sql it completely up to the
  caller to protected againt sql-injections attacks when using this function.
  Never use this function with input read from an untrusted source.
-}
fromBytes :: BS.ByteString -> RawSql
fromBytes =
  SqlSection . BSB.byteString

{- |
  Includes an input parameter in the 'RawSql' statement that will be passed
  using placeholders (e.g. '$1') rather than being included directly in the sql
  statement. This is the correct way to include input from untrusted sources as
  part of a 'RawSql' query. The parameter must be formatted in a textual
  representation, which the database will interpret. The database type for the
  value will be inferred by the database based on its usage in the query.
-}
parameter :: SqlValue -> RawSql
parameter =
  Parameter

{- |
  Includes a bytestring value as string literal in the SQL statement. The
  string literal will be escaped and quoted for you, the value provided does
  not need to include surrounding quotes or escape special characters.

  Note: It's better to use the 'parameter' function where possible to pass
  values to be used as input to a SQL statement. There are some situations
  where PostgreSQL does not allow this, however (for instance, in some DDL
  statements). This function is provided for those situations.
-}

{- |
  Concatenates a list of 'RawSql' values using another 'RawSql' value as
  the a separator between the items.

{- |
  Executes a 'RawSql' value using the 'Conn.executeRaw' function. Make sure
  to read the documentation of 'Conn.executeRaw' for caveats and warnings.
  Use with caution.

  Note that because this is done in 'IO' no callback functions are available to
  be called.

  Executes a 'RawSql' value using the 'Conn.executeRawVoid' function. Make sure
  to read the documentation of 'Conn.executeRawVoid' for caveats and warnings.
  Use with caution.

  Note that because this is done in 'IO' no callback functions are available to
  be called.
